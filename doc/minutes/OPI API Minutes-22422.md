Agenda

-   Review Charter
    -   Define the object models for each of the components and services on the D/IPU
        -   Layering of the D/IPU capabilities that are abstracted
    -   Define Both host system facing and control/management facing
        -   Discovery and Service Advertisement API
        -   Capabilities/Capacity Advertisement API (ARM Cores, Bandwidth, ...)
    -   Create Taxonomy: network, security, storage, ai/ml, gateway, telemetry, ...
    -   Create/Define the Backend/Southbound facing
-   Discuss Capabilities Classification

Notes:

-   Do we need a middleware API to abstract the HAL? Vendor neutral abstraction
-   Configuration Interface (comes from the outside)
-   Interface Abstractions (sets of APIs that are available at the bound
    interface)
    -   Host-bound -- Interfaces provided to the Host (exposed interfaces -- VFs, SRIOV, ...)
    -   Network bound
    -   Local bound
    -   Peer bound
-   Security and Access Model around the Interface Abstractions.

Actions:

-   Define a Layering diagram for the D/IPU elements
-   Define an Interface diagram view for the D/IPU
-   Prioritize to the top set of APIs to define aligned to the Taxonomy set.
