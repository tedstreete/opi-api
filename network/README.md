# OPI Network APIs

## Network API Objectives and Goals

- OPI defines/recommends __protobuf__ definitions that each vendor can tie into the underlying SDKs.
- The __protobuf__ definitions will be aligned with the API and behavioral models available from OVS DB, OpenConfig, OpenFlow, P4, etc. to allow configuration of the service.
- OPI provides a __LAN service__ implementation for the network capabilities that is compatible with OVS, SONiC, VPP, P4, etc.
- OPI defines a __device interface__ for the data services that are delivered through the the PF/VF from the xPU.
- OPI provides a __prototype client__ for sending gRPC, REST protobufs to the xPU for configuation and management.

## Network Use Case

A basic network use case is to provide a LAN/VLAN connection between two servers to allow for container and VM applications to interoperate.

Configuration of the basic use case should consider the ability to setup OVS, SONiC, VPP, and P4 flows through the associated APIs.  Additionally the ability to subscribe to telemetry services such as OTEL is desired to allow for network telemetry information to be delivered.

The basic setup can then be extended to include IPSec traffic flows for building additional services.

## Network APIs to be defined

We have identified two network APIs that need to be defined

- __Configuration and Orchestration__
- __Data Flow__

There is possibly a third API that needs to be considered, __Application__ API.  This API supports the ability to provide service chaining between operations within the DPU which may be processed locally or be terminated into the PF/VF to the CPU complex that handles the Container/VMs.

### OpenConfig Model

The openconfig model below is a majority subset of the full OpenConfig model set.  Some of the available capabilities (such as WiFi) have been left out since the current xPU cards don't currently have support for those specific operations.
